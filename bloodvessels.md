### March 

This project, developed in Python, leverages Markov chains to simulate a probabilistic game. By applying algorithmic strategies and advanced programming techniques, it effectively models stochastic processes and predicts future states based on probability theory. This showcases the ability to analyze and forecast complex scenarios, demonstrating proficiency in working with dynamic systems and uncertainty

### April

Our research helps to improve the visualization of **blood vessels** inside the **biological tissue**. To achieve this goal we carry out research in biophotonics, high noise signals, **digital image processing**, and segmentation algorithms. 

In this research we address the use of the **Discrete Wavelet Transform** (DWT) as a multilevel filtering method and region segmentation techniques to **improve visualization and localization** in LSI images.
