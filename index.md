### About me

I'm a **Computer Science student** at <a href="https://tec.mx/es" target="_blank">*Tecnológico de Monterrey</a> 🇲🇽 with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology and creative thinking.

I’m deeply fascinated by  <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">robotics</a>, programming, and how these fields can transform the way we live.

Outside of tech, you’ll often find me diving into hobbies like basketball 🏀, padel 🎾 or hiking in the mountains 🏔️ exploring nature.

As I move forward in my Computer Science journey, I’m excited about continuing to innovate in areas like robotics and **software development**, exploring how emerging technologies can shape the future.
