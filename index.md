### About me

I'm a **CS student** at <a href="https://tec.mx/es" target="_blank">*Tecnológico de Monterrey</a> 🇲🇽 

Currently, I'm in my 3rd semester 



Most importantly, **I'm always on the lookout for a great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affogato" target="_blank">affogato!</a>**

### Research interests

My interests are in **medical image analysis**, **computer vision**,  and **machine learning**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing and biomedical sciences. 

  
I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:

*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones) 📌
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) 
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) 


If you want to discuss things of images, or **make a collaboration**, send me an [email](mailto:franciscolt@tec.mx?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Friscolt" target="_blank">twitter</a>.


Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
