### Featured Work

Open Source Contributions for Microsoft

During my internship, I developed and integrated automation tools within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to support the Azure SDK release process. These tools are utilized across 34+ Azure SDK repositories.

By building these shared tools, I helped reduce manual work and improve efficiency and reliability throughout the entire Azure SDK ecosystem.

You can check out the repository where these tools were implemented:
