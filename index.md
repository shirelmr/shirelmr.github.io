### About me

As a fourth-semester **Computer Science student** at <a href="https://tec.mx/es" target="_blank">*Tecnológico de Monterrey</a> 🇲🇽, I am driven by a curiosity for technology and it's ability to improve lives.

My interests in Artificial Intelligence and cibersecurity drive my curiosity to understand their applications in real-world challenges and developing innovative solutions.

Beyond academics, I enjoy staying active through hobbies like playing padel 🎾, basketball 🏀 and hiking 🏔️.

As I move forward in my Computer Science journey, I’m excited about continuing to innovate in areas in **software development**, exploring how emerging technologies can shape the future.
